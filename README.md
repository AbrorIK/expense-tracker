# expense-tracker

This project is a comprehensive backend application built using Nest.js, designed to manage users, transactions, and categories, with a strong focus on security, data integrity, and scalability. The application is structured into distinct modules, each handling specific functionalities such as user management, transaction processing, category management, and user authentication.

### Key Features:

1. **User Management:**

   - The application allows users to register and manage their accounts.
   - Each user has a unique profile with secure storage of credentials, facilitated by password hashing and authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).

2. **Transaction Management:**

   - Users can manage their financial transactions, which are categorized as either income or expense.
   - Each transaction includes details such as amount, type, description, and date, and is associated with both a user and a category.
   - CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations are supported for transactions, ensuring that users can fully manage their financial data.

3. **Category Management:**

   - Categories help users organize their transactions.
   - Users can create, update, and delete categories, which can then be assigned to transactions to help in organizing and reporting.

4. **Authentication and Security:**

   - The application uses JWT for secure user authentication, ensuring that only authorized users can access and manage their data.
   - Sensitive routes are protected using JWT guards, enhancing the security of the application.

5. **Reporting and Analytics:**
   - The application includes backend logic for generating summary reports, such as total expenses by category or comparisons between income and expenses.
   - These reports can be used to create insightful charts and visualizations on the frontend.

### Technology Stack:

- **Nest.js**: A progressive Node.js framework for building efficient and scalable server-side applications.
- **PostgreSQL**: A powerful, open-source relational database system used for storing user, transaction, and category data.
- **TypeORM/Prisma**: Used for database interaction, providing an easy-to-use and type-safe query builder.

### Project Structure:

The project is organized into separate modules, each responsible for a specific part of the application:

- **Users Module**: Manages user registration, profile management, and data retrieval.
- **Transactions Module**: Handles the creation, modification, deletion, and retrieval of financial transactions.
- **Categories Module**: Manages the categorization of transactions, allowing for better organization and reporting.
- **Auth Module**: Provides user authentication, including login, registration, and JWT management.

### Deployment and Scalability:

The project is designed with production readiness in mind, including environment configuration, deployment strategies, and security best practices. The application is prepared for deployment to cloud platforms like AWS, Heroku, or DigitalOcean, and is optimized for performance and scalability.

### Testing and Validation:

To ensure robustness and reliability, the project includes unit and integration tests for services, controllers, and guards, alongside validation logic to maintain data integrity and prevent errors in user input.

Overall, this project serves as a solid foundation for a secure, scalable, and maintainable financial management application, with clear separations of concerns and a focus on delivering essential features for users to manage their financial data effectively.
